# PostME
We first need to create an application on which we can use our BDD development. For this we will use Vue CLI to create a project. 
If you don't have vue cli installed on your device use:
```sh
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
```
If you have vue cli installed run :
```sh
vue create postme
```
