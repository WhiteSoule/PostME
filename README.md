# Tutorial BDD
This project has as goal to teach how to work on a project using Behavioural Driven Development. It will create a single page application following the methods of BDD. The application will have no backend to work with but our test files will mock the backend for testing puposes. Since the goal is mainly to teach BDD, the application will not represent a final web application product but rather a simplified version of one.

# Structure
This tutorial will make use of different branches, which will represent the steps for the development. You can either copy this repository and checkout each branch to be sure you have no error for further steps or create your own project and follow along.
Each branch will have its own README file with the instruction for this project. 
The master branch here is the final version of the Application with all the test running and checking correct.

# Tools
We make use of many tools in this project and I will list then here. The installation process will be explained when they are needed but you can install them all in advance as well.
For the creation of our webpage application we make use of:
- Node.js
- VueJS
- vue-router
- axios
- vue-cli
- and some other dependencies that will be installed automatically making use of vue-cli
- 
For the tesing process we make use of: 
- Cucumber
- Cypress
- and cypress-cucumber-preprocessor

# Milestone
1) create empty project (packages installation)
2) write feature files
3) write step definitions and see test fail
4) prepare the structure of the application 
5) do the register features
6) do login features
7) do the profile features
8) test the application and see if everything works fine (Conclusion)

# First Step
